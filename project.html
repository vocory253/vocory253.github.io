                <h2>Huffman Code</h2>
                <p> Implemented the Huffman coding algorithm to achieve efficient data compression by constructing Huffman trees 
                    and analyzing character frequencies. This approach generates optimized binary codes for each character.
                    By leveraging the frequency of characters, the algorithm ensures that more frequently occurring characters
                    are assigned shorter codes. This information can then be used for compression efficiency and streamlining data
                    storage and transmission.

                <h2>Ciphers</h2>
                <p>Developed a multi-cipher encryption system that integrates Caesar Shift, Caesar Key, and Substitution ciphers
                    to offer robust and flexible data encryption. The Caesar Shift Cipher shifts letters by a fixed number of 
                    positions, while the Caesar Key Cipher uses a variable shift based on a secret key for enhanced security. 
                    The Substitution Cipher replaces letters with others based on a predefined mapping, adding another layer of 
                    complexity. By combining these methods, the system ensures versatile and secure data encryption and decryption.

                <h2>Absurdle</h2>
                <p>Absurdle is a variant of the popular word-guessing game Wordle, but with a twist: it is designed to be as 
                    difficult and frustrating as possible for the player. Unlike Wordle, where the game has a fixed secret word
                    that the player tries to guess within six attempts, Absurdle changes the secret word dynamically based on the
                    player's guesses. This means that Absurdle actively works against the player, shifting the target word to 
                    ensure that the player has to continue guessing for as long as possible.
