                <h2>Absurdle</h2>
                <p>Absurdle is a variant of the popular word-guessing game Wordle, but with a twist: it is designed to be as 
                    difficult and frustrating as possible for the player. Unlike Wordle, where the game has a fixed secret word
                    that the player tries to guess within six attempts, Absurdle changes the secret word dynamically based on the
                    player's guesses. This means that Absurdle actively works against the player, shifting the target word to 
                    ensure that the player has to continue guessing for as long as possible.
